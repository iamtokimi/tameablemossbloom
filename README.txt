This mod was developed by manually including clutter 0.6.1 for 1.20 and the fabric intermediary mapped client as libraries.

It is not legal for me to directly share these files, so you will need to obtain them yourself.

To use this source, you *must* include the following files inside the 'libs' directory (Make sure the file names are exact):
* clutter-1.20-0.6.1.jar - Download it from https://modrinth.com/mod/clutter/version/1.20.(0-1)-0.6.1

* fabric-intermediary.jar - Run Minecraft 1.20.1 with Fabric installed at least one time and you should find this inside .minecraft/.fabric/remappedJars/minecraft-1.20.1-[INSERT-LOADER-VERSION-HERE]/client-intermediary.jar
